        solution:
            "We deployed a sophisticated n8n-powered WhatsApp chatbot using the official Business API. Featuring persistent memory and human-like interaction, the bot qualifies leads in real-time. Successful leads are automatically synced to Airtable, an intake email is dispatched, and consultations are scheduled via Outlook and Calendly integration. The system seamlessly escalates complex queries to the human team when necessary.",

            "We developed a 'Marketing Command Center' leveraging Airtable and n8n. The team simply populates an Airtable record with copy, media (carousels, images, or videos), and scheduled times. n8n automatically handles the cross-platform distribution. Post-publication, a secondary workflow retrieves engagement metrics and populates an automated dashboard for performance monitoring.",
